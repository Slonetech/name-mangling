# Explanation of the Code:

# Mapping Class:

The Mapping class has a private method __update that is intended to be a class-private method using name mangling.
In the __init__ method, an empty list items_list is initialized, and the private method __update is called with an iterable argument.
update Method in Mapping Class:

The update method in the Mapping class appends items from the given iterable to the items_list.
Name Mangling for Private Method:

The line __update = update creates a private copy of the update method using name mangling. The mangled name is _Mapping__update.
MappingSubclass Class:

The MappingSubclass class is a subclass of the Mapping class.
It overrides the update method to provide a new signature while still appending items to the items_list.
Creating an Instance:

An instance of MappingSubclass is created with an iterable ['a', 'b'].
Accessing items_list:

The items_list of the instance is accessed and printed. The output is ['a', 'b'].
Accessing Private Method Using Name Mangling:

The private method __update is accessed using name mangling (_Mapping__update) and is called with the iterable ['c', 'd']. This appends items to the items_list.
Accessing items_list Again:

The items_list of the instance is accessed and printed again. The output is ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'].
Code Output:

`['a', 'b']
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']`

## Key Points:

Name mangling is used for creating a private method (__update) in the Mapping class.
The MappingSubclass class overrides the update method with a new signature without breaking the __init__ method of the base class.
Access to the private method is demonstrated using name mangling (_Mapping__update).
This example illustrates how name mangling can be used for a form of encapsulation in Python.
